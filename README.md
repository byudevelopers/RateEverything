# Set Up

First, you will need to set up flutter on your machine. [This website](https://www.projekt202.com/blog/2020/vscode-for-flutter) is a good resource. We are making this project in VSCode, so you will need that installed as well.

After getting flutter set up, clone the project. The project won't run yet. Use the `flutter doctor` to see what you need to fix. Keep running `flutter doctor` and fixing the problems until it works. This command will help you get everything set up (you will need all of the xcode tools and some other things).

Next you need to select a simulator for the project to run on. Click on the simulator spot at the bottom of VS Code.

I use both the iOS Simulator and the Android Pixel Simulator. It is probably good to be able to run both, but start with getting one to work. It is also possible to use your personal device, but it can be tricky. If you need any help, send a slack.

To run the project, use `flutter run`.


## Working on the App

There are a lot of free resources for working with Flutter/Dart. [Pub.dev](https://pub.dev) has flutter widgets that can be used.
